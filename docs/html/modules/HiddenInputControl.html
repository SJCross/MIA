<h1>Input control</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Select which file(s) or folder(s) MIA will process through.  If a file is selected, that file alone will be processed; however, selecting a folder will cause the system to iterate over all files and sub-folders within that folder.  Each file identified here will initialise its own workspace.  <br><br>It is possible to add filters to limit which files are used.  Multiple filters can be applied.<br><br>n.b. This module simply creates the workspace for subsequent analysis; no images are automatically loaded at this point.  To load image data to the workspace use the "Load image" module.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input path</b> (default = "") The file or folder path to process.  If a file is selected, that file alone will be processed.  If a folder is selected, each file in that folder (and all sub-folders) passing the filters will be processed.</li><br><li><b>Simultaneous jobs</b> (default = "1") The number of images that will be processed simultaneously.  If this is set to "1" while processing a folder each valid file will still be processed, they will just complete one at a time.  For large images this is best left as "1" unless using a system with large amounts of RAM.</li><br><li><b>Series mode</b> (default = "All series") For multi-series files, select which series to process:<br><ul><li>"All series" will create a new workspace for each series in the file.</li><li>"Series list" allows a comma-separated list of series numbers to be specified.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Series list</b> (default = "1") Comma-separated list of series numbers to be processed.</li><br><li><b>Only load first file per folder</b> (default = "false") Only load the (alphabetically) first file in each folder.</li><br><li><b>Add filter</b> (default = "") Add another filename filter.  All images to be processed will pass all filters.</li><br><li><b>Spatial units</b> (default = "MICROMETRE") Spatial units for calibrated measurements.  Assuming spatial calibration can be read from the input file when loaded, this will convert the input calibrated units to the units specified here.</li><br></ul>
