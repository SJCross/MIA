<h1>With / without parent</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Filter an object collection based on the presence of a specific parent for each object.  Objects which do/don't have the relevant parent can be removed from the input collection, moved to another collection (and removed from the input collection) or simply counted (but retained in the input collection).  The number of objects failing the filter can be stored as a metadata value.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li>Input objects<ul><li>Description: Objects to be filtered.</li><li>Type: InputObjectsP</li></ul><br><li>Filter mode<ul><li>Description: Controls what happens to objects which don't pass the filter:<br><br>- "Do nothing" Retains all input objects, irrespective of whether they passed or failed the filter.  This is useful when also storing the filter results as metadata values (i.e. just counting the number of objects which pass the filter).<br><br>- "Move filtered objects to new class" Objects failing the filter are moved to a new object class.  The name of the class is determined by the "Output (filtered) objects" parameter.  All existing measurements and relationships are carried forward into the new object collection.<br><br>- "Remove filtered objects" (default) Removes objects failing the filter.  Once removed, these objects are unavailable for further use by modules and won't be included in exported results.<br></li><li>Type: ChoiceP</li><li>Default value: Remove filtered objects</li><li>Choices: <ul><li>Do nothing</li><li>Move filtered objects to new class</li><li>Remove filtered objects</li></ul></li></ul><br><li>Output (filtered) objects<ul><li>Description: New object collection containing input objects which did not pass the filter.  These objects are only stored if "Filter mode" is set to "Move filtered objects to new class".</li><li>Type: OutputObjectsP</li></ul><br><li>Method for filtering<ul><li>Description: Controls whether objects are removed when a specific parent object is present or not:<br><br>- "Remove objects without parent" Objects without the parent specified by "Parent object" are removed, counted or moved (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).<br><br>- "Remove objects with parent" Objects with the parent specified by "Parent object" are removed, counted or moved (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).<br></li><li>Type: ChoiceP</li><li>Default value: Remove objects with parent</li><li>Choices: <ul><li>Remove objects with parent</li><li>Remove objects without parent</li></ul></li></ul><br><li>Parent object<ul><li>Description: Parent object to filter by.  The presence or absence of this relationship will determine which of the input objects are counted, removed or moved (depending on the "Filter mode" parameter).</li><li>Type: ParentObjectsP</li></ul><br><li>Store filter results<ul><li>Description: When selected, the number of removed (or moved) objects is counted and stored as a metadata item (name in the format "FILTER // NUM_[inputObjectsName] WITHOUT [parentObjectsName] PARENT").</li><li>Type: BooleanP</li><li>Default value: false</li></ul><br></ul>
